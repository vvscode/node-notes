### Build a RESTful API

We're going to build a fully-functional JSON API. We'll learn how to parse request-paths, payloads, headers, and query strings, and how to route processing to handlers. This will get you familiar with several key Node modules: "fs", "http", "crypto", "lib", "string-decoder" and "path", to name a few.

### Build a Web App GUI

Our app wouldn't be complete without a frontend, so we're going to build one from scratch. In doing so we'll learn how to serve static assets from Node.js (CSS, images, and javascript files), and how to use Node to create complex templated views.

### Build a CLI Application

Next we're going to build a command-line application that takes user-inputs from the console, processes them, and writes outputs back out. This will get you acquainted with the "readline", "events", "TTY", "V8", and "OS" modules.
